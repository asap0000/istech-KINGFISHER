/**
 * Portable, passphrase-based encryption for the encrypted-backup ("ferry") container.
 *
 * This is deliberately separate from [CryptoManager]: that key lives in the
 * AndroidKeyStore and is bound to a single app+device, so a backup encrypted with it
 * could never be opened by the Pro app (a different applicationId == a different
 * keystore). Backups instead derive their key from a user passphrase via PBKDF2, so the
 * same file can be exported by Lite and imported by Pro on the same — or another — device.
 *
 * Container layout (a single file):
 *   MAGIC (4 bytes, "PCB1") | salt (16) | iv (12) | AES-256-GCM ciphertext (incl. tag)
 * The header (magic|salt|iv) is authenticated as GCM AAD so tampering is detected.
